# Blended Texture Workflow - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create a ComfyUI workflow in API format that generates seamless blended floor textures for video games. The workflow generates a base grass texture (1024x1024), then pads it 1024px to the right and generates a stone texture with natural mixing/blending at the boundary (grass growing between stones, stone fragments in grass).

**Goals:**
- Generate high-quality hand-painted game textures
- Natural transition between grass and stone materials
- Maintain API format for programmatic use
- Seamless tiling support

**Key Challenge:** The existing workflow (`test_simple_inpaint_refined_grass_2_api.json`) creates hard boundaries between materials. We need organic blending where materials intermix.

## Technical Analysis

### Current Workflow Issues

The existing workflow has these problems:

1. **Node 11 (ImagePadForOutpaint)**: `feathering: 0` creates a binary mask with hard edge
2. **Node 16 (VAEEncodeForInpaint)**: `grow_mask_by: 12` only slightly expands the inpaint region
3. **Node 17 (KSampler - Stone)**: Uses full `denoise: 1.0`, completely replacing content in mask area
4. **No transition zone**: The workflow fills grass (left 1024px) then stone (right 1024px) with no overlap
5. **Prompt doesn't request blending**: Stone prompt actively excludes grass in negative prompt

### Root Cause

The workflow treats the boundary as a **hard cut** rather than a **transition zone**. To get natural blending, we need:

1. A wider transition mask that overlaps both materials
2. Lower denoise strength to preserve underlying textures
3. A dedicated "blend pass" with prompts asking for mixed elements
4. Multiple inpainting passes: first fill new area, then blend boundary

## Solution Architecture

### Three-Stage Approach

**Stage 1: Generate Base Grass Texture** (existing, works well)
- Generate 1024x1024 grass base
- Refine with img2img pass
- Output: Clean grass tile

**Stage 2: Generate Stone Texture** (existing, works well)
- Pad canvas 1024px to the right
- Inpaint stone floor in new area
- Output: Grass + Stone with hard boundary

**Stage 3: Blend Transition Zone** (NEW - this is the key improvement)
- Create a 300px wide mask centered on boundary (150px into grass, 150px into stone)
- Use low denoise (0.6-0.7) to preserve both textures underneath
- Prompt explicitly requests mixed elements (grass in stone cracks, stone chips in grass)
- Output: Naturally blended transition

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Transition mask X position | 874px | Centers 300px mask on 1024px boundary (1024 - 150 = 874) |
| Transition mask width | 300px | 150px into each material for gradual blend |
| Blend denoise strength | 0.6-0.7 | Low enough to preserve both textures, high enough to add new elements |
| Blend CFG | 7.0 | Standard guidance for balance |
| Blend steps | 30 | More steps for smoother blending |

### Node Dependencies

```
Grass Pipeline:
1 (Checkpoint) → 3 (LoRA) → 7 (KSampler) → 8 (VAEDecode) → 9 (Save)
                            ↓
                   13 (VAEEncode) → 14 (Refine KSampler) → 15 (VAEDecode) → 21 (Save)

Padding:
15 (Refined Grass) → 11 (Pad Right) → 12 (Save)

Stone Pipeline:
400 (Inpaint Checkpoint) → 401 (LoRA) → 17 (Stone KSampler) → 18 (VAEDecode)
11 (Padded) → 16 (VAEEncodeForInpaint) ↗                            ↓
                                                        19 (Composite) → 20 (Save - if no blend)

Blend Pipeline (NEW):
100 (Create Rect Mask - 300px transition zone)
19 (Grass+Stone) → 103 (VAEEncodeForInpaint) → 104 (Blend KSampler) → 105 (VAEDecode)
100 (Mask) ↗                                                              ↓
                                                             106 (Composite) → 20 (Save Final)
```

## Phases

### Phase 1: Analyze Existing Workflow
**Goal:** Understand current structure, identify exact nodes causing hard boundaries

**Tasks:**
- Read and parse `test_simple_inpaint_refined_grass_2_api.json`
- Document all nodes and their connections
- Identify mask creation and inpainting parameters
- Test current workflow to confirm hard boundary issue

**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of what needs to change

### Phase 2: Design Blend Strategy
**Goal:** Determine optimal parameters for natural blending

**Tasks:**
- Research: What denoise strength preserves underlying content?
- Research: What mask width gives natural transitions?
- Design transition zone dimensions (recommend 300px: 150px each side)
- Design blend prompts (grass in stone cracks, stone chips in grass, moss, weathering)
- Choose blend sampler settings (steps, CFG, denoise)

**Deliverable:** Parameter specifications for Phase 3

### Phase 3: Create New Workflow with Blend Pass
**Goal:** Implement the new workflow in API format

**Tasks:**
- Copy existing workflow as base
- Add new nodes:
  - Node 100: `Create Rect Mask` for transition zone (x=874, width=300)
  - Node 101: Positive prompt for blending
  - Node 102: Negative prompt avoiding hard edges
  - Node 103: `VAEEncodeForInpaint` for blend region
  - Node 104: `KSampler` with low denoise (0.65)
  - Node 105: `VAEDecode` for blend result
  - Node 106: `ImageCompositeMasked` to apply blend
- Update node 20 (final save) to use output from node 106 instead of 19
- Validate JSON structure
- Add descriptive `_meta.title` for all nodes

**Deliverable:** `workflows/grass_stone_blended_transition_api.json`

### Phase 4: Testing and Iteration
**Goal:** Verify blending works, tune parameters if needed

**Tasks:**
- Test workflow locally with `--output-directory` flag
- Verify all stages save correctly (grass base, refined, padded, final blended)
- Inspect transition zone for:
  - Grass growing in stone cracks ✓
  - Stone fragments in grass ✓
  - Natural weathering/moss ✓
  - No hard boundary line ✓
- If blending insufficient, iterate on:
  - Denoise strength (try 0.6, 0.65, 0.7)
  - Mask width (try 250px, 300px, 350px)
  - Blend prompt wording
  - Number of steps (try 25, 30, 35)

**Deliverable:** Tuned workflow with natural blending

### Phase 5: Documentation
**Goal:** Document the workflow for future use

**Tasks:**
- Add comments to workflow explaining each stage
- Document recommended parameter ranges
- Add usage instructions to CLAUDE.md or separate README
- Document how to adapt for other material combinations (grass→dirt, stone→wood, etc.)

**Deliverable:** Documentation for using and adapting the workflow

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Feathered Mask on Initial Pad
**Approach:** Set `feathering: 100` on node 11 (ImagePadForOutpaint)

**Pros:**
- Simpler, uses existing nodes
- Single pass blending

**Cons:**
- Feathering creates gradient transparency, not material mixing
- Stone inpainting would just fade to transparent, not blend textures
- Doesn't add grass elements to stone or vice versa
- **Rejected:** Feathering is for soft edges, not material mixing

### Alternative 2: ControlNet Depth/Edge Guidance
**Approach:** Use ControlNet with edge detection to guide blending

**Pros:**
- Very precise control over blend regions
- Could preserve specific structural elements

**Cons:**
- Requires additional models (ControlNet weights)
- Much more complex workflow
- Slower inference
- Overkill for organic material blending
- **Rejected:** Too complex for this use case

### Alternative 3: Multiple Overlapping Inpaint Passes
**Approach:** Create 3-4 narrow masks with progressively lower denoise

**Pros:**
- Extremely smooth gradual transition
- Fine-grained control

**Cons:**
- Workflow becomes very long (8+ additional nodes per pass)
- Much slower (4x inpainting operations)
- Diminishing returns after first blend pass
- **Rejected:** Single well-tuned blend pass should suffice

### Alternative 4: Post-Process Blending with Image Operations
**Approach:** Generate both textures separately, use image blending nodes (ImageBlend, ImageComposite with gradients)

**Pros:**
- Deterministic blending
- Fast execution

**Cons:**
- Simple alpha blending, not semantic mixing
- Wouldn't add grass elements to stone or stone chips to grass
- Looks artificial (gradient overlay rather than natural growth)
- **Rejected:** Need semantic understanding, not just pixel blending

**Selected Solution:** Alternative 0 (our main proposal) - dedicated inpaint blend pass with low denoise and explicit mixing prompt. Best balance of simplicity, quality, and semantic understanding.

## Testing Strategy

     - Grass blades/tufts in stone cracks
     - Stone fragments scattered in grass edge
     - Moss or weathering on stones near grass
     - Gradual material transition (not abrupt)
  4. **Tiling test:** Place result side-by-side horizontally, verify seamless tile

- **Success Criteria:**
  - Workflow executes without errors
  - All checkpoint/LoRA/VAE files found
  - Output matches local results
  - Execution time reasonable (<2 minutes)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Blend denoise too high → loses original textures | Medium | High | Start at 0.6, iterate up carefully |
| Blend denoise too low → no mixing visible | Medium | High | Test range 0.6-0.75, find sweet spot |
| Transition mask too narrow → still looks like hard edge | Low | Medium | Use 300px minimum (150px each side) |
| Transition mask too wide → affects too much of each texture | Low | Medium | 300px is <15% of each side, should be safe |
| Create Rect Mask node not available | Low | Critical | Check custom nodes, install if needed |
| Blend prompt ignored by model | Low | Medium | Use strong descriptive terms, test prompt variations |
| Workflow breaks on RunPod (missing dependencies) | Low | High | Test early in Phase 4, verify all nodes available |

## Final Implementation Summary

### Workflow: `grass_stone_blended_transition_api.json`

**Architecture:**
Three-stage workflow generating seamless blended floor textures (grass → stone):

1. **Stage 1: Grass Generation** (Nodes 1-15, 21)
   - Generate base grass texture (1024x1024, seed 42)
   - Refine with img2img pass (seed 43, denoise 0.8)
   - Outputs: step1_grass_base, step2_grass_refined

2. **Stage 2: Stone Generation** (Nodes 11-12, 16-19, 22, 400-401, 50-51)
   - Pad canvas 1024px to the right (total: 2048x1024)
   - Inpaint stone texture using inpainting checkpoint
   - Outputs: step3_grass_plus_blank, step3b_grass_and_stone_before_blend

3. **Stage 3: Blend Transition** (Nodes 100-106, 112-114)
   - Create 1024px wide transition zone (512px into each material)
   - Blur mask edges for soft gradients
   - Inpaint with low denoise and mixing prompt
   - Composite result
   - Output: step4_grass_stone_BLENDED_FINAL

### Final Parameters (Tuned)

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Transition Zone** | | |
| Width | 1024px | Covers 512px into grass, 512px into stone (~50% of each tile) |
| X Position | 774px | Centers zone on 1024px boundary |
| **Blend Sampler** | | |
| Denoise | 0.85 | High blend intensity - generates 85% new mixed content |
| CFG | 8.0 | Strong prompt adherence for mixing elements |
| Steps | 40 | High quality refinement |
| Seed | 45 | Reproducible blending |
| **Mask Processing** | | |
| Blur Radius | 48px | Maximum blur for soft transitions |
| Blur Sigma Factor | 2.0 | Strong blur effect |
| Grow Mask By | 0 | No additional mask expansion (blur provides softness) |

### Key Nodes Explained

**Node 100: Create Rect Mask**
- Creates white rectangle on black background (IMAGE type)
- Defines transition zone boundaries
- Returns IMAGE, not MASK (must be converted)

**Node 113: Blur**
- Applies Gaussian blur to rectangle edges
- Creates soft gradient transition
- Critical for avoiding hard boundaries

**Node 114: Image To Mask**
- Converts blurred IMAGE to MASK type
- Required for VAEEncodeForInpaint
- Uses intensity method

**Node 103: VAEEncodeForInpaint**
- Encodes image + mask for inpainting
- Receives pixels from node 19 (grass + stone composite)
- Receives mask from node 114 (blurred transition zone)

**Node 104: KSampler (Blend)**
- High denoise (0.85) generates new mixed content
- Prompt explicitly requests grass/stone mixing
- Negative prompt avoids hard edges

**Node 106: ImageCompositeMasked**
- Composites blend result onto original
- Uses same blurred mask for smooth integration

### Prompts

**Blend Positive (Node 101):**
```
natural transition between grass and stone, grass growing between stone cracks,
moss on stones, weathered stone edges with grass, organic boundary, small grass
tufts emerging from stone gaps, stone fragments scattered in grass, seamless
blend, hand painted game texture
```

**Blend Negative (Node 102):**
```
blurry, low quality, hard edge, sharp boundary, visible seam, cut line, abrupt change
```

### Iteration History

**Initial attempt (denoise 0.65, 300px zone):**
- Result: 100% stone in transition, hard line on grass edge
- Issue: Denoise too high for narrow zone, no mask blur

**Second attempt (denoise 0.4, 300px zone with blur):**
- Result: Gray strip with feathering, no actual texture
- Issue: Denoise too low, preserved averaged gray pixels

**Third attempt (denoise 0.75, 500px zone with blur):**
- Result: Better mixing, visible grass and stone elements
- Issue: Transition still somewhat narrow

**Final (denoise 0.85, 1024px zone with blur):**
- Result: ✓ Extensive blending across half of each tile
- Result: ✓ Natural material mixing with soft edges
- Result: ✓ No visible hard boundaries
- User confirmed satisfactory

### Debugging Insights

1. **Create Rect Mask returns IMAGE, not MASK**
   - Must use Image To Mask node for type conversion
   - Common mistake: directly connecting to VAEEncodeForInpaint

2. **Blur node parameter is `sigma_factor`, not `sigma`**
   - Wrong parameter name causes node execution failure
   - Workflow silently stops, returns fewer output images

3. **Low denoise preserves averaged pixels, not textures**
   - In blurred mask zones, gray pixels from averaging get preserved
   - Need denoise ≥0.75 to actually generate new content

4. **Workflow debugging via SaveImage nodes**
   - Added node 22 to save pre-blend composite
   - Verified stone generation before blend pass
   - Critical for isolating which stage failed

5. **Transition zone width vs denoise balance**
   - Wider zones need higher denoise to fill effectively
   - Narrow zones + high denoise = too much replacement
   - 1024px zone + 0.85 denoise = optimal for this use case

### Adaptation Guide

**To adjust blend intensity:**
- More mixing: Increase denoise (try 0.9)
- More preservation: Decrease denoise (try 0.7)
- Sharper edges: Reduce blur radius (try 24)
- Softer edges: Keep blur at maximum (48)

**To adjust transition width:**
- Wider: Increase width, adjust x = 1024 - (width/2)
- Narrower: Decrease width, adjust x accordingly
- Example: 800px wide → x = 1024 - 400 = 624

**To adapt for other materials:**
1. Change grass prompts (nodes 4, 10) to first material
2. Change stone prompts (nodes 50, 51) to second material
3. Update blend prompt (node 101) to describe material mixing
4. Keep same transition architecture and parameters
5. Test and adjust denoise if needed

**For different tile sizes:**
- Workflow assumes 1024x1024 base tile
- Adjust nodes 6 (EmptyLatentImage) and 11 (ImagePadForOutpaint)
- Recalculate transition zone x position based on boundary

### Performance

**Execution time (RunPod serverless):**
- Total: ~90-120 seconds
- Stage 1 (Grass): ~25-30s
- Stage 2 (Stone): ~25-30s
- Stage 3 (Blend): ~30-40s (longer due to higher steps)

**Output images:**
- 5 images total (1 base, 1 refined, 1 padded, 1 pre-blend, 1 final)
- Final image: 2048x1024 (grass left, stone right, blended center)

**Cost optimization:**
- Use min_workers=0 for infrequent generation
- Use min_workers=1 if generating frequently
- Consider batching multiple variations (different seeds)
